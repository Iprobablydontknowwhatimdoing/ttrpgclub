# Adventure Club Weekly Update: New Meeting Days!

Dear Adventurers,

Welcome to the second weekly email! The goal of these emails is to keep you updated on what's happening in the club, when we're meeting, and how you can help out.

If you have feedback on this email, or any questions, please let me know.

***

## **TL;DR for Returning Readers**
For those who read last week's email, here are the key changes:
*   **New One-Shot Days:** Meetings are now **Mondays and Fridays** after school due to scheduling conflicts.
*   **Interim Officers:** We have interim officers assigned by the school, but we are still looking for official elected officers.
*   **Club To-Do List:** The to-do list and bucket list have been updated based on progress and shifting priorities.

***

## **Overview / Agenda**
*   When are we meeting & What games are there? // Starting your own game
*   Help out the club! // Things that need doing
*   Join as an officer // Elections & Nominations
*   Get your friends to join! // QR Code & Intake form

***

## **1: Meetings**

*   **tldr:** One-shots are **Mondays and Fridays** this week right after school in the commons for 1.5-2+ hours.

Now that we are an official club, we can continue our meetings! I will be GMing (leading) one-shots for people who are interested in trying it out.

We will be playing **Nimble RPG**, a simplified version of 5e. While not required, it is highly recommended that you come to the table having watched and/or read the quickstart guide and their videos to get a feel for the game.

**One-Shot Times**

*   **tldr:** One-shots are **Mondays and Fridays** this week. I will leave after 15 minutes if no one shows up.

Due to scheduling conflicts, the one-shots will now be on **Mondays and Fridays** this week. Please meet me in the Commons ~10 minutes after class ends. **Important:** I will wait for 15 minutes, and if no one arrives by then, I will have to leave.

If these days don't work for you, please email me. Depending on demand, I may see if I can shift my schedule to accommodate other times.

Though most sessions don't have a hard time limit, my goal is for the session to take around 1.5-2 hours. If people have time and want to stay, we can continue until 6:00 (hard deadline). If you have to leave early, that is perfectly fine, just let me know.

**Starting your own campaign**

*   **tldr:** email me

If you want to start your own campaign, that's awesome and we want to help! While we don't have funds yet, we can offer publicity (in this email) and a space to play. If you're interested, please email me.

## **2: Help out the Club!**

*   **tldr:** email me if you want to help out

To run and grow the club, we need constant support from all our members! Here is the updated club to-do list:

**Club to-do list (in no particular order):**

*   Elect Officers
*   Posters (for hanging around the school) - **Update: One person has volunteered to help, thank you! More help is always welcome.**
*   Finish preparing the Teams group - **Update: I will be handling this.**
*   **Set up other forms of communication (e.g., Discord)**
*   Add GM resources to the SharePoint
*   Start Campaigns
*   Invite GMs to the SharePoint
*   Finish the website
*   Make templates for communications

If any of those things sound like something you would be willing to do or have the expertise to do, please email me.

**Bucket List**
These are things that I want to do at some point, but can wait.

*   Fundraising & sponsorships
*   Poll & buy various TTRPG systems with fundraised funds
*   Reach out to WotC for sponsorship
*   Find & setup a good task software
*   Make universal session base (safety stuff)
*   Build a catalogue of adventures
*   Make a curriculum for new GMs
*   Build a social media presence

If any of those sound interesting, please email me, but the club to-do list is the priority for now.

**Skills we're looking for:**

*   Experience in Grantwriting and / or Fundraising
*   Experience in HTML / CSS / JS (for website development)
*   Experience running club elections
*   Any GMing experience
*   Club communications (emails, websites, etc...)
*   Social Media
*   Photography

## **3: Join as an Officer**

*   **tldr:** We have interim officers, but if you're interested in being an *elected* V.P., Treasurer, or Secretary, email me. Deadline: November 1st.

This team doesn't run itself! We currently have some interim officers that don't have any responsibilities other than those assigned by the school district, but I hope to get actual officers soon. We need elected officers to help manage communications, schedule time slots, manage finances, etc.

If you are interested in an officer role, please email me. When we have enough people interested, we will hold an election.

**Open Roles:**

*   **Vice President** - helps me do a lot of the day-to-day managing of the club.
*   **Treasurer** - manages finances, grants, fundraising, and anything else involving money.
*   **Secretary** - Manages communications and schedules officer meetings; will likely be the one writing this email in the future.

The deadline for applications is **November 1st**, but that may be extended if there aren't enough applicants.

## **4: Get your friends to join!**

## **One More Thing**
Thank you all so much for your patience and enthusiasm as we get this club started. I'm looking forward to playing together!

If you have any questions, concerns, or ideas, please, as always, email me.

Good luck, have fun, and have an amazing rest of your day
