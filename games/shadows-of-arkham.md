# Shadows of Arkham

## Campaign Overview

1920s Massachusetts. A series of disappearances in the sleepy town of Arkham has caught the attention of our investigators. What began as a simple missing persons case has spiraled into something far more sinisterâ€”something that defies rational explanation.

## Tone & Themes

This is a **horror investigation** campaign focusing on:
- Cosmic horror and existential dread
- Mystery-solving and clue-gathering
- Character-driven drama
- Sanity as a resource
- 1920s historical flavor

## Current Arc

The investigators have uncovered evidence of a secret society operating within Arkham's elite social circles. Their next move: infiltrating a masquerade ball at the Blackwood Estate.
